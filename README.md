# Call4
At All4One Fintech, we believe that we can improve the historical 'bank account secret coding system', by introducing a 'Call4' Verification System where a financial customer uses a Base64 Text Encoding System to self-generate a new secret code from time to time, in order to make transactions; as well as to protect their accounts from being hacked by bad players.
